Check out some animal photos real easy!

The plan is for this to be an angular webapp that cycles through cats using a web api on a swipe or mouse click.

Once cats are done, then I will move on to adding in other animals, starting will birds and dogs.

For now I using the Unsplash API to get the images. Eventually I will move to my own API.

To build this app you will need Node and Angular installed on your PC.

You will also need to register with the unsplash api: https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account, and add the access token to your own secrets.ts file.
