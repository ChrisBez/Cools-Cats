# Cools-Cats
Check out some cats real easy!

The plan is for this to be an angular webapp that cycles through cats using a web api on a swipe or mouse click.

Once cats are done, then I will move on to adding in other animals, starting will birds and dogs.

At this point I am planning to use the Unsplash API to get the images


To build this app you will need Node and Angular installed on your PC.

You will also need to register with the unsplah api: https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account and get a token to download images from them.
