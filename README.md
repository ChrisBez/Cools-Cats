# Cools-Cats
Check out the cats on Imgur real easy!

The plan is for this to be an angular webapp that cycles through cats using the imgur api on a swipe or mouse click.

Once cats are done, then I will move on to adding in other animals, starting will birds and dogs.


To build this app you will need Node and Angular installed on your PC.

You will also need to register with the imgur api: https://api.imgur.com/ and get a token to download images from them.
